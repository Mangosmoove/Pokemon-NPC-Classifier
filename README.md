For our project, we decided to explore the various NPC trainers found in Pokemon games. In the games, a player can battle with their pokemon team (containing up to 6 pokemon) against an NPC’s pokemon team (also containing up to 6 pokemon), and there are some patterns in which pokemon an NPC may have based on their title or class. For instance, for an NPC named ‘Sailor Andrew’, the class is Sailor, and Sailors often have more water-based pokemon than any other element. Our project is to discover hidden patterns in NPC trainers players can encounter from Generation 1 through 4 games. Based on our model, we will then allow for a user to enter up to a team of 6 pokemon they would have on their own team, and predict what NPC trainer class they would belong to. Because we are working in a group of 3, we decided to also expand the project to include a nice graphical user interface using Django post semester.
